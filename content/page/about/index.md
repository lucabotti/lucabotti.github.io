# Hello, world

## About this blog / site / whatever
Now and then, I try to setup a blog in a non-intrusive way. This time, I am setting on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), which is a static site generator.

## About me
At the bottom of this page, courtesy of the theme I am using, you will find some links to know a little more about me. 
Just some remarks here:
 - Born in 1970
 - First computer in 1983 (Commodore 64)
 - Enjoyed programming immediately (fun with _peek_ and _poke_)
 - Moved on to 
   - Amiga - _Video Games_ and _C Programming_
   - MS DOS - _Turbo Pascal_, _Turbo C_, _Turbo Vision Libraries_
   - Windows - _Delphi_, _PowerBuilder_, _Java_
   - **Linux** (finally!) - _Python_, _Java_, _Cloud_, _DevOps_

Currently running my business - [RED Software Systems](https://red.software.systems) in Monza, Italy
