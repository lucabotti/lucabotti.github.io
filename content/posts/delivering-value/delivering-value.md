# Delivering ~~software~~ value

## A straining relationship
From the software development side of thing, one of the most fundamental misunderstandings is that the technical excellence is, by itself, a value.

As developers, architects, team leaders, we often strive in obtaining the best practices, which often are just the latest trendy articles from who knows who blog, and that delivering something based on our own beliefs will be of value to the customers.

Well, guess what? It is not. Value, for our customers, be them the user of a website or the corporate drone of a Fortune 500 company, is what let them work in a simple and intuitive way, completing workflows requested to them without the need to be a technical savy user.

A user does not care about docker, kubernetes, java, react or whatever comes to mind - he/she only wants to use the software for the task assigned to him/her, and, at the proper time, locke the computer and move on for dinner, picking up the kids, or whatever he/she want to do.

Users don't care about your precisely crafted and styled web component, your single page application, adherence to microservices standards, or whatever is the latest discussion _du jour_. The only value they see in your work is the way your work allows them to do what is needed to close the task.

And often we (developers) tend to think that we know better: we know what is better for them, be it the composition of the page, or absurd workflows and limitations for the users.

Your software is not yours. Is for who uses it. Remember it.
