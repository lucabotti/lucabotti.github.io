# Delivering ~~software~~ value

## A straining relationship
Thanks to my twenty+ years of experience first as a developer and then as an architect, I have gained this valuable insight:

"**_...From the perspective of software development, one of the most common misunderstandings is that technical excellence, in itself, represents value..._**"


As developers, architects, team leaders, we often strive in obtaining the best practices, which often are just the latest trendy articles from who knows who blog, and that delivering something based on our own beliefs will be of value to the customers.

Well, guess what? It is not. **_Value, for our customers_**, be them the user of a website or the corporate drone of a Fortune 500 company, **_is what let them work in a simple and intuitive way_**, completing workflows requested to them without the need to be a technical savy user.

A user does not care about docker, kubernetes, java, react or whatever comes to mind - he/she only wants to use the software for the task assigned to him/her, and, at the proper time, lock the computer and move on for dinner, picking up the kids, or whatever he/she wants to do. A user only wants to use a system that simplifies his/her activities and execution times, and being more efficient on the job.

**_Users don't care about your precisely crafted and styled web component_**, your single page application, **_adherence to microservices standards_**, or whatever is the latest discussion _du jour_. The only value they see in your work is the way your work allows them to do what is needed to close the task.

And often we (developers) **_tend to think that we know better_**: we know what is better for them, be it the composition of the page, or absurd workflows and limitations for the users.

**_Your software is not yours. Is for who uses it. Remember it._**

Software is your product, but it should arise from listening to and deeply understanding the user and their work experience. In a sense, it is a mysterious and technically complex object, yet it must reach its user in the most intuitive and straightforward way possible.

The developer is like a tailor who must craft a custom-made suit that is perfect for the client, not for the extraordinary artisan. With care, skill, and patience, they must create something not centered on themselves but on the needs of the person in front of them!
