At [RED Software Systems](https://red.software.systems) we recently switched from the Atlassian Suite to GitHub.

Considerations for doing so come down mostly to price and the complexity of the suite and the overlapping of some tools with others.

We highly value Jira, and BitBucket as a service is second to none. But the complexity of the tooling - Jira - is astounding, and gets in the way for the kind of relatively small projects we follow.

Even a small company like us has accumulated around 300 private repositories in the past ten years, so a manual migration through the web interface is out of discussion.
